## Description

A webpage that shows a series of rows labeled with the 8 business hours.  the text fields are colored based upon what the current hour of the day is.  When text is entered into the text field and the save button is pressed it saves that text and displays it upon the page reloading.

The color of the text fields is determined by comparing the value of the id attribute associated with each text field to the current hour stored in the variable hour, grey for past, red for current hour, and green for future.

Upon pressing the save button the tet within the text area is saved within local storage labeled with the id attribute associated with the text field.  Upon page load this data is displayed within the text field labeled with the id attribute.
